## Conclusion

Australia's AI security approach has strengths in technical guidance (ACSC) and government policy (ISM, PSPF), but lags international peers in:

1. **Mandatory private sector requirements** (EU leads)
2. **Unified Safety/Security approach** (UK leads)
3. **Practical assessment tools** (Singapore leads)
4. **Adversarial ML framework** (US leads)
5. **Government AI security requirements** (Canada leads)

Closing these gaps requires learning from international approaches while adapting to Australian context.
